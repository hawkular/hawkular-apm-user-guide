Publishing Trace Fragments to the APM Server
--------------------------------------------

Trace fragments are published to the APM server via a REST API: link:../apiref/rest.html#POST__traces_fragments[Publish Trace Fragment]

The REST service uses basic authentication, and therefore appropriate username and password details for a valid user will need to be supplied with the POST request.
