= Analysing Captured Application Data

toc::[]


Once the server has been installed, and started, you will be able to start up the user interface by pointing a browser to: http://localhost:<port>

_Where 'port' is the port used by the server (e.g. 8080 by default)._

At this point, you will be prompted to login.

NOTE: If starting the server for the first time, you will need to create a user. See the previous section for instructions on how to do this.

== Components

image::apm-components.png[]

This page shows component information related to the applications being monitored.

The lefthand side of the page provides a collapsible sidebar with various filters that can be applied to the information being viewed. This is explained in more detail in a later section.

The graph shows aggregated durations for the component types being monitored, at the defined intervals. The interval can be changed using the dropdown at the top of the graph.

The table presents the performance information aggregated based on the component type (e.g. Database, EJB, Consumer, etc), URI and (if relevant) operation name.

The metrics provided are _count_ (the number of activity records aggregated), the _elapsed_ time and _actual_ time. The _elapsed_ time represents the total time spent within a particular component (including calls to child components). The _actual_ time represents only the time specific in the component itself.

This information can be used to identify performance bottlenecks within an application. Using details about the amount of 'actual' time specific within a component, combined with the number of times it is invoked, can help locate the best opportunities for making performance improvements.

== Distributed Tracing

image::apm-trace.png[]

This page shows a graphical representation of the path taken by interactions through a set of distributed services.

The lefthand side of the page provides a collapsible sidebar with various filters that can be applied to the information being viewed. This is explained in more detail in a later section.

At the top of the graph is a dropdown providing a list of initial (root) nodes for the paths that can be displayed. Once a path is selected, the invocation path will be displayed as a set of connected nodes.

Each node reflects its severity as a colour, ranging from _green_ meaning performing well, up to _red_ indicating an area for further investigation.

The nodes also provide information about the average duration spent in the node, the number of times the node has been invoked, and provides a tooltip with more detailed stats.

The links also provide information about the number of invocations, and a tooltip with more detailed stats.

The graph can be zoomed and scrolled to view the relevant parts of the information. There is a 'reset zoom' button to return to the original (initial) version of the graph.

At the top of the page is another button showing the number of trace instances that comprise the aggregated service interaction view. If this button is selected, it shows a table of the individual instances.

image::apm-trace-instances.png[]

The instances can further be filtered by entering some text, or by providing a duration range, in the fields at the top of the table.

Once an instance of interest is located, the _Details_ column icon can be selected to show a diagram of the call trace instance.

image::apm-trace-instance-diagram.png[]

The symbol on the left of the diagram represents the consumer of a message. Solid grey lines show control flow.

The hexagon represents a component, with an icon identifying the type of component. In the above image, the first component is an EJB as indicated by the coffee cup. The second component is a database activity.

The dotted grey line represents a concurrent activity being performed. In this case three separate concurrent activities are performed within the scope of the EJB, after the database query.

Each of the concurrent activities have the same pattern in this example image. They start with a 'producer' (or service invocation) calling another service. The communication across service boundaries is represented by a solid black line. The invoked service (associated with the URL /book in this case) then triggers another concurrent activity which invokes a further service.

== Filter Sidebar

On the lefthand side of some of the UI pages (Application Performance and Distributed Tracing currently) is an area for specifying filters that can be used to limit the information being viewed.

The _Business Transaction_ list will include any business transactions that have been defined. This can be used to focus the Application Performance information just on a specific business transaction to help identify performance bottlenecks.

The _Properties_ section enables properties associated with business transactions to be used to define inclusion or exclusion filters. The name of the property can be selected from a dropdown.

== Business Transactions

=== Overview

This page shows information about the business transactions, separated into tabs for the following categories.

==== Managed

image::apm-btm-managed.png[]

This tab shows summary statistics for a list of actively managed or disabled business transactions.

On the left of the page is two pie charts representing the transaction and fault counts across the business transactions.

Each business transaction is further presented with the following statistics:

* The number of completed instances of the business transaction (per hour)

* The completion time 95 percentile (per hour)

* The number of instances that completed with faults (per hour)

For each business transaction:

* Users can navigate to the detailed statistical information about the business transaction by selecting the transactions names.

* If available, selecting the cog icon will take the user to the business transaction's configuration page. The cog is only visible for business transactions defined via the UI (i.e. not explicitly by the application).

* The trash icon is used to delete the business transaction. As with the cog icon, it will only be visible if the business transaction was created via the UI.


==== Candidates

image::apm-btm-candidates.png[]

The candidates tab is used to identify interactions (associated with URIs) that have not currently be associated with a business transaction. When new URIs are detected, a red flag symbol will appear next to the _Candidates_ tab name.

At the top of the page, it is possible to either enter the name of a new business transaction, or select one of the existing business transactions from a drop down list. Once a name has been entered, or existing one selected, then the list of URIs will become enabled.

The user can select zero or more of the URIs that are appropriate for the business transaction. These URIs will be used to create _inclusion filters (regular expressions)_ that will enable the interactions associated with those URIs to be allocated to the business transaction.

To avoid having an extremely long list of URIs, where a REST call involves a URI with one or more path parameters, the system will attempt to identify common patterns, and where found, present a single URI with the '*' meta character in place of the path segment associated with a parameter. If the user selects such a URI to be associated with a business transaction, this will result in an 'evaluate URI' action automatically being defined, to extract the path parameter(s). An effort is made to infer the name of the parameter(s), but these may need to be manually edited to define a meaningful name.

If a new business transaction is being created, then the user can click either the *_Manage_* or *_Ignore_* buttons. This will determine the initial reporting level of the business transaction, as to whether instances of this transaction will be reported to the server (i.e. managed) or not (i.e. ignored).

If an existing business transaction is selected, then pressing the *_Update_* button will associate the inclusion filter for any checked URIs with the existing business transaction.

Whichever button is selected, the user will be taken to the configuration page for the business transaction. See the following section for information on how to configure the business transaction.


==== Ignored

This tab lists the business transactions that are being ignored.

This state exists to enable business transaction instances to be categorised, and permanently marked as not being of interest. By explicitly identifying even business interactions that are not of interest, it is possible to detect any new traffic that may occur that has not previously be categorised, which informs the administrators that attention is required to investigate the unfamilar interactions.

=== Information

image::apm-btm-btxn.png[]

The page is divided into three main regions.

The top graph shows an aggregated view of the stats associated with completed business transactions subject to any defined time span and other filter criteria (e.g. faults and/or properties). The stats are displayed as line charts for min, average and max values. A bar chart is used to dusplay the number of transactions, and the number of transactions that completed with a fault.

The left hand bottom pie chart displays the faults that occurred. If a pie chart segment representing a particular fault is selected, it will add that fault as a filter, focusing all the data in the other charts on the business transactions associated with that fault.

The right hand bottom region defines the business transaction properties that are available. The user can select a particular property from the dropdown menu, and its information will be displayed in a pie chart. As with the fault pie chart, selecting one of the pie chart segments will add that property name and value as a filter on the data viewed in the page.

Both the fault and property filters are displayed at the top of the page. When displayed in green, they will filter out business transactions with that fault or property value. If however the user selects the filter, it will toggle to become red, representing the fact that data should be shown that does *not* contain that fault or property value.

=== Configuration

image::apm-btm-btxn-config.png[]

Whenever changes are saved, or the form is initially displayed, any validation errors will be displayed. Errors will also be highlighted on the form, by the appropriate field labels being displayed in red.

The configuration for a business transaction is separated into three sections.

==== Description

Simply enables the user to provide a description of the business transaction and its scope (in case it incorporates a number of different invocations).

==== Filters

The filters section defines the link between the transaction instances, performed on specific URIs, and the business transaction name.

This is achieved by defining one or more inclusion filter regular expressions that may match a URI. Once a URI is matched against one of the inclusion filters, it may then be matched against the exclusion filter regular expressions (if defined) to determine if a subset of the included URIs should be excluded.

Once a transaction instance has been associated with a business transaction, the _Reporting Level_ is used to determine how that business transaction instance should be handled.

.Reporting Levels
|===
|Level |Description

|All |This level means that all information about the business transaction should be reported

|None | This means that the business transaction is temporarily disabled so no information should be reported

|Ignore | This means that the business transaction is permanently disabled so not of interest

|===

==== Processors

Out of the box, Hawkular APM is configured with instrumentation rules for a selection of technologies, that can used to monitor generic information about business transaction instances executing over those technologies.

However, to make this information more useful in a business context, it is important to also be able to extract relevant details from the business messages, to aid future analysis. This section will explain how the additional "business transaction specific configuration" can be provided.

Zero or more processors can be defined for a business transaction. If none are defined, then the business transaction configuration will simply be used to associate specific interactions with the business transaction name.

If a processor is defined, it is comprised of an initial set of parameters to identify which specific node(s) in the business transaction call trace are to be processed, and then a set of actions that should be performed. The actions will be discussed further down.

.Processor Criteria
|===
|Field |Description

|Node Type |This field identifies the type of call trace _node_ that the processor will be applied to, with possible values of _Consumer_, _Producer_ or _Component_

|Direction |The direction the interaction being processed will flow, either _In_ or _Out_

|URI Filter |Regular expression that can optionally be defined to isolate the nodes of interest, where multiple nodes of the same type may occur within the same transaction instance

|Operation |For _Component_ node types, the optional operation name can be used to identify a specific node in the call trace

|Predicate |A predicate can be defined to provide finer grained filtering on whether the processor should be applied to a particular call trace node, which by default is not specified

|===

As mentioned, each processor can define multiple actions to be performed on nodes that meet the criteria associated with the processor. For example, the following action is used to set a property on the trace.

image::apm-btm-btxn-config-action.png[]

Each action can also be guarded by its own predicate, so that not all actions will be performed for each node that passes the processor's overall criteria. The default is no predicate for the actions.

The fields that need to be defined for an action will be specific to the action type, and therefore are listed in the description fields for the action:

.Actions
|===
|Action Type |Description

|Add Content |Include content in the business transaction fragment node. Fields are '*_name_*' to distinguish content if multiple entries will be defined, '*_type_*' to classify the content type, and an expression (see below) to determine how the content is derived

|Evaluate URI |Apply a template to the URI to extract path and query parameters, e.g. /customer/{customerId} or /orders?{id}

|Set Detail |Extract a node specific value. The '*_name_*' field represents the name associated with the detail, and  an expression (see below) to determine how the value is derived

|Set Fault Code |Define a fault code value. The expression (see below) determines how the value is derived

|Set Fault Description |Define a fault description value. The expression (see below) determines how the value is derived

|Set Property |Extract a named business property. The '*_name_*' field names the business property, and the expression (see below) determines how the value is derived

|===


.Expressions (for Predicates and Values)
|===
|Expression Type | Description

|Literal | A literal value. When used as a predicate, only values _true_ or _false_ are valid.

|XML | XPath expression applied to a XML document. The _Source_ field identifies where the information is obtained from (e.g. Content, Header). The _Key_ is dependent upon the source, if _Content_ then the key represents the index in an array of arguments, if _Header_ then the key is the header property name.

|JSON | JSONPath Expression applied to a JSON document. The _Source_ field identifies where the information is obtained from (e.g. Content, Header). The _Key_ is dependent upon the source, if _Content_ then the key represents the index in an array of arguments, if _Header_ then the key is the header property name.

|Text _(for Values only, not Predicates)_ | Converts a value into text form. The _Source_ field identifies where the information is obtained from (e.g. Content, Header). The _Key_ is dependent upon the source, if _Content_ then the key represents the index in an array of arguments, if _Header_ then the key is the header property name.
